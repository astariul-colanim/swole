Welcome to swole's documentation !
==================================

**Swole** is a framework that let you build web apps only in a few lines of Python code.

It's very similar to ``streamlit``, but more performant and easier to customize.

You can find the code in `this repository <https://github.com/astariul/swole>`_.
